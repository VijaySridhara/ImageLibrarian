## Welcome to ImageLibrarian Page

Here I will divide the pages into three parts. The first page or home page is for the most, who just want latest release "Binary" for download :) 
The Documentation page for documentation, and finally the Developer page for developer upates. 

### _Mind you this is still a beta release_
##Features in Beta 0.1
1. Ability to do a nondestructive caching of images 
2. Ability to load quickly from cache
3. Ability to create Multiple Archives
4. Each archive can store "Category" and "Subcategory"
5. Archive can be password protected (just for display purpose)
6. Meta data, Comments and Tags can be added against images 
7. Simple editor to crop, resize , rotate, flip the image
8. Export with resize format 


So without wasting any time, where is my download
